# warehouse_navigation

This reposotory is for the "Object Detection for Autonomous Navigation in Simulation using Mobile Robot" project.

The project was completed as an assignment for the CSCI-8910 Fundamentals of Robotics course.

This repository is very similar to that of https://github.com/PhizzleNG/Warehouse_monitor.  Warehouse_monitor focuses on AMCL in a Gazebo map with static objects. Warehouse_navigation focuses on Gmapping in a Gazebo map with animated actors.
